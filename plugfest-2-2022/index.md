## Frequently Asked Questions

### Questions About Eligibility

**If I am a wallet implementer and did not participate in PlugFest 1, am I eligible to participate in PlugFest 2?**

Yes!  We are excited that you are joining us in this important work.  While it is not necessary for you to have participated in PlugFest 1, we are requiring that all participants in PlugFest 2 successfully demonstrate that their wallet can hold a verifiable credential in the OBv3 format.  This is the credential format that we will use for PlugFest 2.

The PlugFest team will issue a JFF credential to your wallet using the DID method of your choice.  Please provide the information request in the registration form.  If you are unclear how to proceed, please send an email to Joan Lee, [jlee@jfflabs.org](maito:jlee@jfflabs.org).

**If I am a credential issuing platform and did not participate in PlugFest 1, am I eligible to participate in Plugfest 2?**

Yes!  We are excited that you are joining us in this important work.  Credential issuing platforms were not eligible to participate in PlugFest 1, so there are no new additional requirements for their participation in PlugFest 2.

**What is an example of a credential issuing platform?**

Credential issuing platforms issue verifiable credentials as a service to any wallet, including those not provided by their own platform.

**Are educational institutions eligible to participate in PlugFest 2 as a credential issuing platform?**

Educational institutions, training providers, and other credential providers are eligible to participate if the credential issuing service is universally available to others outside their organization.  

### Questions About Technical Requirements

**What are the technical requirements for wallet implementers?**

* Display: Verifiable credential (OBv3) from at least two different credential issuers
* Display: badge image, issuer name, achievement name, achievement description, achievement criteria
* Optional Display: issuer logo & other Open Badges v3 terms


**What are the technical requirements for credential issuing platforms?**

* Issue: Verifiable credential (OBv3) to at least two different wallets (using VC-API/CHAPI, OpenID Connect, and/or DID-Comm Presentation Exchange)
* Optional Display: badge image, issuer name, issuer logo, achievement name, achievement description, achievement criteria, & other Open Badges v3 terms

**Can we participate if we have not yet decided which protocol to implement?**

Yes!  The VC-EDU plugfest team is excited to learn more about the different wallet/issuing solutions and are happy to provide technical support and resources to teams who are in the process of selecting a protocol.  Please indicate your interest using the form or by using the VC-EDU mailing list [https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-vc-edu/](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-vc-edu/). 

**Can we participate if we do not intend to implement one of the three protocols (VC-API/CHAPI, OpenID Connect, DID-Comm Presentation Exchange)?**

In order to participate, you must select at least one of the three protocols.

**Can we use a different verifiable credential that is not an open badge (OBv3)?**

For the purpose of this plugfest, we will be focusing on a single achievement verifiable credential that all wallets are able accept (OBv3).  Participants in PlugFest 2 are welcome to make suggestions on other verifiable credential formats in coordination.  If there is demand for these formats by wallet implementers within the PlugFest 2 cohort, the plugfest team is open to considering these other credentials.

**Will credential issuers be required to use DIDs?**
Yes.

**Will DID Authentication be required?**
Yes.

**Who decides which DID method to use - wallet or credential issuing platforms?**

It's a collaborative decision

### Questions About Funding

**Will there be funding to support technical development or team coordination activities for this Plugfest?**

$10,000 will be available to each organization (wallet/issuer/both) that demonstrates successful execution of the technical requirements.  As in PlugFest 1, participants will be required to submit a video on ahead of demo day (November 14, 2022).  Additional information will be provided in September.
